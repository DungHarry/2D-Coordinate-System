2D-Coordinate-System
====================

This is the simulating program for 2D Coordinate System in C++ programming language

The program allows user can enter the two coordinates of a point(x, y) in order and it will takes it into a struct array. Detail:

struct point {
  int x;
  int y;
};

After that, some task will be executed:

- Convert it into coordinates system corresponding
- Compute maximum and minimum of x and y coordinate
- Paint all points to standard output
